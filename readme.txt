The easiest way to gain email subscribers through creating lead magnets and content upgrades.

== Description ==

Create a lead magnet right form within your WordPress editor without ever having to touch code. It's never been easier to create a library of subscriber-attracting lead magnets and content upgrades from within WordPress.

If you've been creating lead magnets to attract new email subscribers, odds are you're having to use at least two different apps to do it--sometimes more. It's a lot of work. 

Wouldn't it be great if you could create a form, add your downloadable thing, and insert it into your blog post all without ever having to leave the WordPress editor? 

And how great would it be to have every asset you create to be manageable right inside WordPress too?

Even better, what if all those assets you create could be displayed on a single page on your site as a growing "Resource Library" where you could continually attract new subscribers and keep them coming back for more?

That's exactly what Content Magnets helps you do.

= Create Lead Magnet Forms =
Firstly, Content Magnets adds the "Magnet" block to your Gutenberg editor. Add the block to create a brand new lead magnet form or select from your previously created Magnets.

Give your Magnet a title, description, and add an image if you want. Once you've done that you have the ability to: 

* Customize form submit button text
* Add redirect URL (ie. â€˜Thank youâ€™ page)
* Add a Success message
* Link to the downloadable file
* Customize form colors (background, Title, Description, button, etc.)

The whole process can take less than a minute.

= Build Your Resource Library =

Want to show your readers just how much value youâ€™re creating for them? Content Magnets will automatically create an Archive page of all the Magnets youâ€™ve created.

Your readers can browse the page and opt-in for any of the resources they like.

From the back end you can manage, update, add, or delete your created Magnets just like any other WordPress post.

= Subscribers Saved to Your Database =

Every time a reader opts into a Magnet they are saved to your WordPress database. You can access the list of subscribers under the Content Magnets > Subscribers tab. 

At any time you can choose to export all subscriber data to easily import it into your email marketing software of choice.

For those who want to integrate it directly into the email marketing software, we will be building those integrations soon and releasing them on <a href="https://contentmagnets.com/" target="_blank" rel="friend">our website</a> soon.

= GDPR Compliance =

Since our plugin captures user data and also uses browser cookies to ensure subscribers can download content, you will want to provide some appropriate language to your website Privacy Policy. Weâ€™ve provided a sample of in the plugin Settings.
